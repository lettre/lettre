### v0.11.14 (2025-02-23)

This release deprecates the `rustls-tls`, `tokio1-rustls-tls` and `async-std1-rustls-tls`
features, which will be removed in lettre v0.12.

rustls users should start migrating to the `rustls`, `tokio1-rustls` and
`async-std1-rustls` features. Unlike the deprecated _*rustls-tls_ features,
which automatically enabled the `ring` and `webpki-roots` backends, the new
features do not. To complete the migration, users must either enable the
`aws-lc-rs` or the `ring` feature. Additionally, those who rely on `webpki-roots`
for TLS certificate verification must now explicitly enable its feature.
Users of `rustls-native-certs` do not need to enable `webpki-roots`.

Find out more about the new features via the [lettre rustls docs].

#### Features

should always be present in the message.

##### Before

```rust
Message::builder()
  // [...] some headers skipped for brevity
  .body(String::from("A plaintext or html body"))?
```

##### Patch

```diff
 Message::builder()
   // [...] some headers skipped for brevity
+  .header(ContentType::TEXT_PLAIN) // or `TEXT_HTML` if the body is html
   .body(String::from("A plaintext or html body"))?
```

### v0.10.0 (2022-06-29)

#### Upgrade notes

Several breaking changes were made between 0.9 and 0.10, but changes should be straightforward:

* MSRV is now 1.56.0
* The `lettre_email` crate has been merged into `lettre`. To migrate, replace `lettre_email` with `lettre::message`
  and make sure to enable the `builder` feature (it's enabled by default).
* `SendableEmail` has been renamed to `Email` and `EmailBuilder::build()` produces it directly. To migrate,
  rename `SendableEmail` to `Email`.
* The `serde-impls` feature has been renamed to `serde`. To migrate, rename the feature.

#### Features

* Add `tokio` 1 support
* Add `rustls` support
* Add `async-std` support. NOTE: native-tls isn't supported when using async-std for the smtp transport.
* Allow enabling multiple SMTP authentication mechanisms
* Allow providing a custom message id
* Allow sending raw emails

#### Breaking Changes

* Merge `lettre_email` into `lettre`
* Merge `Email` and `SendableEmail` into `lettre::message::Email`
* SmtpTransport is now an high level SMTP client. It provides connection pooling and shortcuts for building clients using commonly desired values
* Refactor `TlsParameters` implementation to not expose the internal TLS library
* `FileTransport` writes emails into `.eml` instead of `.json`
* When the hostname feature is disabled or hostname cannot be fetched, `127.0.0.1` is used instead of `localhost` as EHLO parameter (for better RFC compliance and mail server compatibility)
* The `sendmail` and `file` transports aren't enabled by default anymore.
* The `new` method of `ClientId` is deprecated
* Rename `serde-impls` feature to `serde`
* The `SendmailTransport` now uses the `sendmail` command in current `PATH` by default instead of
  `/usr/bin/sendmail`.

#### Bug Fixes

* Fix argument injection in `SendmailTransport` (see [RUSTSEC-2020-0069](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/master/crates/lettre/RUSTSEC-2020-0069.md))
* Correctly encode header values containing non-ASCII characters
* Timeout bug causing infinite hang
* Fix doc tests in website
* Fix docs for `domain` field

#### Misc

* Improve documentation, examples and tests
* Replace `line-wrap`, `email`, `bufstream` with our own implementations
* Remove `bytes`
* Remove `time`
* Remove `fast_chemail`
* Update `base64` to 0.13
* Update `hostname` to 0.3
* Update to `nom` 6
* Replace `log` with `tracing`
* Move CI to GitHub Actions
* Use criterion for benchmarks
